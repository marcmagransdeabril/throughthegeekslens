## 📖 Overview


What do a crowded airport in Beijing, parenting, the risk-return frontier, and micromanaging bosses have in common? Everything—if you look at the world through the right lens.

In Through the Geek’s Lens, you’ll embark on a personal, humorous, and yet thought-provoking journey through some fundamental trade-offs and models from mathematics, psychology, economics, and engineering. Through the eyes of a textbook lover, Through the Geek’s Lens opens unexplored mental horizons and connects the dots between accumulated scientific knowledge and our private and professional lives.

The book introduces and explains complex subjects, their factual basis, and their limitations by contextualizing them within a specific time and place—a moment in the author's personal life. Each section offers a small dose of actionable insight. Among the many topics explored are the trade-off between freedom and security, the diminishing returns faced by particle accelerators and large machine-learning models, and the No Free Lunch Theorem, which explains why a self-confident explorer like the author can get lost in an unknown forest. It applies paraconsistent logic to interpret Eastern philosophies and uses unbiased statistical sampling to show how to see your loved ones. It discusses the Law of Small Numbers and why it’s just as important as the Law of Large Numbers, the determination of Service Level Agreements using basic probability inequalities, and the Shannon-Hartley Theorem to decide when to shout (or not) at your kids. And that’s just the beginning—there’s much more to discover when you look your day to day through a geek’s lens.
